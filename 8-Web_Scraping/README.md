Part 1: Scraping Mars News Titles and Previews

Objective:
Extract titles and preview text from news articles about Mars to monitor and track ongoing developments.

Process:

Automated Browsing & Data Extraction:
I’ll begin by using Splinter to automate browsing and gather the raw HTML from the Mars News website. I’ll inspect the page to identify key HTML elements—namely, the article titles and preview text.

With Beautiful Soup, I'll parse the page and focus on extracting the title and preview text. These elements are key for quickly understanding the nature of each article, helping me track the latest updates on Mars exploration and research.

Data Storage:
I'll structure the data as a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary containing two key-value pairs: title (the article’s headline) and preview (a brief summary or teaser of the article). For example:

python
Copy code
{'title': "NASA's MAVEN Observes Martian Light Show Caused by Major Solar Storm", 
 'preview': "For the first time in its eight years orbiting Mars, NASA’s MAVEN mission witnessed two different types of ultraviolet aurorae simultaneously, the result of solar storms that began on Aug. 27."}

The goal is to create a streamlined structure where each article's details can be easily accessed and analyzed for relevant trends.

Optional Step (Exporting Data):
For sharing or future reference, I’ll optionally export the collected data to a JSON file, making it easier to share with colleagues or incorporate into larger projects.

Outcome:
The final product is a comprehensive, easily accessible list of recent Mars news articles, which can be used to track the latest trends and discoveries in Mars exploration.

Part 2: Scraping and Analyzing Mars Weather Data

Objective:
Extract and analyze Mars weather data, specifically the Curiosity rover's temperature and pressure readings, to assess long-term weather patterns on Mars.

Process:

Automated Browsing & Data Extraction:
Using Splinter, I'll automate browsing to the Mars Temperature Data site and use Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML table containing Mars weather data. Since the data is structured in a table, I can use this to directly scrape the weather records associated with each Martian day (sol).

Data Cleaning & Structuring:
After scraping, I’ll clean the data and load it into a Pandas DataFrame. The DataFrame will include key columns such as terrestrial_date, sol, min_temp, and pressure. I will ensure all data is in the correct type (e.g., date, integer, float) for proper analysis.

Example of the dataset:

id	terrestrial_date	sol	min_temp	pressure
1	2021-07-01	1000	-80.0	800
2	2021-07-02	1001	-78.2	820

Data Analysis:
With the structured dataset, I will analyze it using Pandas to answer key questions:

How many months exist on Mars?
By grouping the data by the month column, I can easily count the number of unique months in the dataset.

How many Martian days of data do we have?
The number of rows in the dataset corresponds to the number of Martian days captured by the rover. I'll count these to track the duration of data collection.

Insights and Visualizations:

Temperature Trends:
I’ll calculate the average minimum temperature for each Martian month to identify the coldest and warmest months. This information is vital for understanding seasonal variations on Mars, which have implications for future exploration and habitation planning. A bar chart will help visualize this.

Pressure Analysis:
I’ll also calculate the average atmospheric pressure per Martian month to understand pressure trends. This analysis can shed light on seasonal atmospheric changes and how these fluctuations might impact rover operations or future missions. Again, I’ll create a bar chart to visualize this.

Estimating Martian Year Length:
To estimate the number of Earth days in a Martian year, I will use the temperature data over time. I'll visually estimate this by plotting the temperature over the course of the data, identifying the cyclical nature of Martian seasons and calculating an average length for a Martian year in Earth days.

Data Export:
Finally, I’ll export the cleaned and analyzed data to a CSV file for further use or sharing with others in the space exploration community.

Outcome:
A fully analyzed dataset that provides insights into Martian weather patterns, including temperature variations, pressure fluctuations, and estimates of the Martian year. These insights are essential for planning future missions and understanding Mars’ environment.

Summary of Findings:
Mars News:
The list of Mars news articles gives a high-level overview of ongoing research and exploration, helping track important updates like mission milestones or scientific discoveries.

Mars Weather Data:
The weather analysis will provide critical insights into the long-term weather patterns on Mars, including:

The number of months on Mars.
The average temperature per month (coldest and warmest months).
The pressure trends that could affect Mars missions.
A visual estimate of the length of a Martian year in Earth days.

Real-World Application:
The Mars News data is useful for keeping track of ongoing missions and scientific discoveries related to Mars exploration.
The Mars Weather Data is crucial for long-term planning of Mars missions, from lander and rover operations to human exploration considerations. Temperature and pressure trends influence equipment design, resource management, and mission scheduling.
