# Clinical Trial Analysis - Pymaceuticals Drug Evaluation

## Purpose of the Project

The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of Pymaceuticals' drug, Capomulin, in treating mice with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumors. The study involves 249 mice treated with various drug regimens over a 45-day period, and our objective is to determine which drug regimen shows the most promise in reducing tumor volume. This analysis is crucial not only for reporting on the clinical trial findings but also for providing insights into the factors influencing the effectiveness of cancer treatments.

By comparing Capomulin’s performance to other treatments, we aim to uncover meaningful trends and correlations that can inform decisions about future clinical studies and drug development. This will also allow stakeholders to evaluate the consistency and potential of Capomulin, with an eye towards refining treatment strategies in real-world applications.

## Key Steps and Analysis

### 1. Data Preparation:
The first step in the analysis involves merging two datasets—mouse_metadata and study_results—to create a comprehensive dataset that includes all relevant details for each mouse. A critical part of this process is identifying and removing duplicate timepoints, which can skew the analysis. Cleaning the data ensures that each mouse is represented once per timepoint, maintaining the integrity of the study’s findings.

**Why it matters:** Proper data preparation is essential for drawing accurate conclusions. Ensuring that there are no duplicates or inconsistencies prevents the risk of data artifacts influencing the results, which could lead to incorrect assessments of the drug regimens.

### 2. Summary Statistics:
We calculate key summary statistics—mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean (SEM)—for tumor volumes across the different treatment regimens. These metrics help to understand the central tendency and the variation in the tumor response for each drug.

**Why it matters:** Summary statistics provide a high-level view of how each drug regimen is performing. Identifying which treatments have high variance can suggest that more consistent or predictable results may be needed for future studies or clinical applications. Consistent results are crucial for making informed decisions about the viability of a drug.

### 3. Visualization - Bar Charts & Pie Charts:
To communicate the data effectively, we use bar charts and pie charts:

- **Bar charts** show the total number of observations (mice/timepoints) for each treatment regimen. This helps assess whether the study is well-balanced across treatments.
- **Pie charts** visualize the gender distribution of the mice, ensuring that there’s no significant gender bias in the study.

**Why it matters:** Visualizations are an effective way to quickly grasp important trends. Understanding the balance of treatment groups and gender representation can ensure that the results are generalizable and not skewed by underlying biases.

### 4. Quartile Calculation, Outliers, and Box Plots:
Next, we focus on the final tumor volumes for each mouse, calculating the quartiles (Q1, Q3), the interquartile range (IQR), and identifying any outliers. Box plots visually represent the distribution of final tumor volumes, with outliers clearly marked.

**Why it matters:** Identifying outliers is crucial as they may represent either significant treatment responses or data collection errors. Understanding the range of tumor volumes helps to evaluate how effective each treatment regimen is and provides insights into the variability of the treatment effects.

### 5. Line Plot and Scatter Plot:
- **Line plot**: For one mouse treated with Capomulin, we generate a line plot to track tumor volume over time, which allows us to visualize how the tumor progressed and assess the treatment’s effectiveness.
- **Scatter plot**: For the entire Capomulin regimen, we plot mouse weight against average tumor volume to explore whether there is a correlation between the weight of the mice and their tumor responses.

**Why it matters:** These plots help us visualize trends over time and relationships between variables, offering deeper insights into treatment efficacy. The scatter plot, in particular, may uncover potential factors—such as the weight of the mice—that correlate with tumor growth, which could inform future research directions.

### 6. Correlation and Regression:
In this step, we examine the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment group. We calculate the correlation coefficient to determine the strength of the relationship and apply linear regression to create a model for predicting tumor volume based on mouse weight.

**Why it matters:** Understanding the relationship between physical characteristics (like weight) and tumor growth is crucial for tailoring treatment strategies. Linear regression allows us to predict tumor development, potentially helping in early detection and intervention strategies.

### 7. Conclusion:
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the clinical trial results, focusing on the effectiveness of Capomulin compared to other treatments. Key takeaways include:
- Identifying the most consistent and effective drug regimens.
- Detecting outliers that may indicate unusual responses or data issues.
- Understanding the factors—such as mouse weight—that may influence tumor growth and treatment efficacy.

**Why it matters:** The insights gained from this analysis not only help assess the success of Capomulin but also provide broader insights into how to optimize future cancer treatments. By focusing on data-driven decisions, stakeholders can refine clinical practices, target specific areas of improvement, and potentially accelerate the development of effective cancer therapies.
