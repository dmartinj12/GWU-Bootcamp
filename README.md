# GWU-Bootcamp

## Overview
This repository contains all the homework assignments I completed during the George Washington University Data Analytics Bootcamp. Each folder corresponds to a specific module of the course, showcasing a range of skills and tools used in the data analytics field. The assignments demonstrate proficiency in data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning, as well as foundational web development techniques.

## Repository Structure
Below is a breakdown of the repository structure and a brief description of each module:

1. **Excel**: Assignments leveraging Excel for data cleaning, formatting, and analysis, including advanced features like pivot tables and conditional formatting.

2. **VBA**: Projects utilizing Visual Basic for Applications to automate tasks and enhance Excel's functionality through custom scripts.

3. **Python**: General Python programming assignments, covering fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, functions, and data structures.

4. **Pandas**: Exercises focusing on data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library, including handling large datasets and performing group operations.

5. **Matplotlib**: Visualization projects using Matplotlib to create insightful plots and charts that communicate data effectively.

6. **NoSQL**: Assignments exploring NoSQL databases, focusing on data storage and retrieval in non-relational database systems like MongoDB.

7. **SQLAlchemy**: Work involving SQLAlchemy for database interaction, ORM functionality, and querying relational databases in Python.

8. **Web_Scraping**: Projects that involve extracting data from web pages using tools like Beautiful Soup and Selenium.

9. **Web_Development**: Assignments introducing basic web development concepts, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration.
