Home Sales Analysis: Project Overview and Approach
This project involves leveraging PySpark SQL to analyze a home sales dataset and perform various queries to determine patterns and insights based on multiple filters such as home features (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage) and other variables like view ratings, year built, and more. The main goal is to process the data using PySpark, perform computations on a large dataset efficiently, and evaluate how caching, partitioning, and various performance optimizations impact query runtime.

1. Repository Setup
Purpose: This project focuses on analyzing home sales data using PySpark, so we set up a clean repository dedicated to this task. We clone the repository, ensuring all work is properly versioned and easily accessible for future enhancements or evaluations.

2. Data Loading and Initial Setup
Spark Session: To begin the project, we set up a Spark session, which is essential for any PySpark-related tasks. This enables us to interact with Spark and execute SQL queries.

Data Import: The home_sales_revised.csv dataset is loaded into a Spark DataFrame. This step converts the raw CSV file into a structured DataFrame, making it ready for SQL-style querying. The DataFrame is then registered as a temporary table called home_sales, allowing us to use SQL queries on it seamlessly.

3. SQL Queries for Insights
Query 1: Average Price of a Four-Bedroom House per Year
Objective: This query focuses on filtering homes with exactly four bedrooms and computes the average price of these homes for each year they were sold.

Analysis: We're looking for trends in how the prices of four-bedroom homes have changed over the years. The use of the GROUP BY clause helps us break down the data by the year the home was sold, giving insight into price fluctuations.

Query 2: Average Price for Homes with Specific Features (Three Bedrooms, Three Bathrooms)
Objective: This query narrows the filter to homes with exactly three bedrooms and three bathrooms, and computes the average price for each year the home was built.

Analysis: By comparing the average prices of homes with consistent features over time, this query provides insights into how the market values homes with these attributes.

Query 3: Homes with Three Bedrooms, Three Bathrooms, Two Floors, and ≥2000 Square Feet
Objective: Here, we add more criteria: homes must have at least three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and be greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet.

Analysis: This refined filter allows us to identify a specific subset of homes and assess how they perform in terms of average price based on their construction year. It’s particularly useful for understanding market dynamics for larger homes over time.

Query 4: Average Price per View Rating for Homes with Average Price ≥ $350,000
Objective: This query examines homes with an average price greater than or equal to $350,000 and calculates the average price per "view" rating.

Analysis: By segmenting homes by their view rating, we are exploring whether there’s any correlation between the view quality and price for higher-end homes. The runtime of this query is also measured to evaluate how long it takes to execute.

4. Performance Optimization with Caching and Partitioning
Caching the home_sales Table
Purpose: Caching improves the performance of repeated queries. By caching the temporary home_sales table, we ensure that Spark keeps the DataFrame in memory after the first computation, avoiding the overhead of reading the data again on subsequent queries.

Validation: To ensure caching is effective, we check if the home_sales table is indeed cached, ensuring better performance for further queries.

Evaluating Cache Impact on Query Performance
Objective: We run the expensive query (Query 4) both before and after caching the home_sales table. The runtime difference gives us insight into the performance gain from caching, which is essential when working with large datasets.
Partitioning the Data by date_built
Purpose: Partitioning the data ensures that Spark organizes the data by specific fields, such as date_built. This can improve query performance by reducing the amount of data that Spark needs to scan when performing operations that involve these columns.

Temporary Table for Parquet Data: The partitioned data is saved in Parquet format and loaded back into a temporary table for further analysis. This format and partitioning allow us to efficiently query the data.

Impact on Performance: By comparing the query runtime before and after partitioning, we assess how partitioning the data by date_built impacts the speed of our queries, especially for large datasets.

5. Uncaching and Final Validation
Uncaching: Once performance optimizations like caching and partitioning are applied, we uncache the home_sales temporary table. This ensures that the data is not stored in memory, allowing us to verify that the table has indeed been uncached properly.

Validation: We verify that the table is no longer cached using PySpark’s caching methods, ensuring that the system is functioning as expected.

Performance Considerations
By running these queries and evaluating the performance impact of caching, partitioning, and different query optimizations, we gain a deeper understanding of how to efficiently analyze large datasets. This exercise demonstrates that:

Caching can significantly reduce query time for repeated analyses.
Partitioning by key fields can improve query performance for specific types of analyses.
Proper data organization and optimization strategies are essential when working with big data.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates practical techniques for handling and analyzing large datasets using PySpark. By leveraging SQL queries, performance optimization techniques like caching and partitioning, and evaluating runtime performance, we not only gain insights into the home sales data but also improve our skills in managing data at scale. The exercises also highlight the importance of efficient data handling and the trade-offs between computation and memory usage when working with big data.
